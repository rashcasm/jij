                    With bleak sights after the family loss.<br>
                    No place left for us to grow.<br>
                    Not even someone to share our sorrow.<br>
                    But we don't wanna die<br>

                    We heard them screaming,<br>
                    Wondered if it was just the beginning.<br>
                    We have seen bleeding bodies piled up.<br>
                    Kept in the coffin of hatred, all lined up.<br>

                    With shattered hearts, standing so far.<br>
                    We don't understand your boundaries or religion.<br>
                    But now this city of corpse is a prison.<br>
                    We don't know if they are terrorists or politicians.<br>
                    But for them, we are just an exception.<br>
                    We are all alone and our tears have already dried.<br>
                    Who cares for infants and for the people who have died?<br>

                    What kind of God would let this happen?<br>
                    What kind of God will watch a soul burn in heaven?<br>
                    You say that he hear, help and bless<br>
                    But what kind of God would see this mess?<br>
                    God has allowed too much but he can't kill my empathy.<br>
                    And if God exists then why he never show his sympathy.<br>
                    And if there is a God then tell him to beg for my forgiveness.<br>
                    I saw people screaming his name, I call it their foolishness.<br>
                    I will go and tell them that your God is dead,<br>
                    And go worship sin as it's been said.<br>
                    So if god exists then why is he blind<br>
                    And is he really a god or just a Satan of other kind?<br>

                    You might wonder how my limbs look so green<br>
                    Because they forgot how to scream,<br>
                    When each piece was torn perfectly with beak.<br>
                    Veins announced their end, now no one to seek.<br>

                    It will be eaten by a man or hound.<br>
                    They say the second one hurts less<br>
                    Even though both of them looks for some flesh.<br>
